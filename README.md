### Summary of the AI-Enabled School Education System

**Objective:**
The goal of the project is to develop an AI-enabled education system as a proof of concept for Class 1 in a primary school setting. The aim is to enhance educational outcomes using data-driven insights and AI-powered tools.

**Key Features:**

1. **User-Specific Dashboards:**
   - **Teachers:** Dashboards for inputting student performance data, viewing class performance, and accessing customized lesson plans.
   - **Parents:** Read-only dashboards to monitor their child's performance.
   - **Principals and Administrators:** Dashboards to view comprehensive reports on student, teacher, and class performance, and to manage lesson plans.

2. **Educational Framework:**
   - **Hierarchy of Goals:** The system is structured around broad educational goals, curricular goals, competencies, and measurable learning outcomes to ensure a comprehensive approach to student development.
   - **Competencies and Learning Outcomes:** The system focuses on specific competencies and learning outcomes, which are the measurable skills and knowledge that students should demonstrate.

3. **Assessment and Reporting:**
   - **Student Performance Reports:** Generated based on activities that measure specific competencies and learning outcomes.
   - **Teacher Performance Reports:** Analyzed through student outcomes and only accessible to administrators and principals.
   - **Class Performance Reports:** Provide an aggregate view of student performance in a class.

4. **Customized Lesson Plans:**
   - Tailored lesson plans are generated based on the identified learning needs and gaps for each student to address specific educational requirements and improve outcomes.

5. **Activities and Grading:**
   - The system includes a range of activities designed to target specific competencies. These activities are graded on a scale from 1 to 5 to quantify student development in various competencies.

6. **Learning Gaps and Needs:**
   - **Learning Gaps:** Identified as the difference between what a student has learned and what they were expected to learn.
   - **Learning Needs:** Specific requirements for each student to address their learning gaps, which guide the creation of customized lesson plans.

By integrating AI and data-driven methodologies, this project aims to enhance educational quality and provide personalized learning experiences, thereby improving educational outcomes for students.
